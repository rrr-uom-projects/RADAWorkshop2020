Those weights are coefficients in kernels that are used to do convolutions on the image and extract features. For a good explanation of what is going on in convolutions, have a look at the materials [here](http://www.google.co.uk). The convolutional parts of a CNN are performing 'feature extraction'. Feature extraction is the process where we take a 2D image and find a representation of it in a higher dimensional space such that we can classify images by finding the difference between them in that high dimensional space.\n",

There are a lot of losses, but the most appropriate in our case is either the binary_crossentropy loss, or the categorical_crossentropy loss. These two losses tell us how similar the distribution of labels given by the model and those in the observations are. The ideal value for both is zero, so we are looking for the loss value to go down and approach zero. \n",

We can try changing this part of the training later to see if we get better performance.\n",

Fortunately, keras provides some very good optimizers out of the box.

This is an 11 million dimensional partial differential equation in our case, so it is very much not trivial! \n",

Optimizers also have a learning rate parameter, which controls how quickly they step along the direction of decreasing gradient. this can be very important, as steps too large can end up oscillating around a minimum rather than converging to it.\n",
